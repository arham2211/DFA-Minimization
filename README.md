# DFA-Minimization

# How to run the code

TO RUN THE PROGRAM, OPEN "updateddiag.py" IN ANY PYTHON INTERPRETER. VSCODE WORKS. 
THEN SIMPLY RUN THE PROGRAM AND YOU WILL SEE THE GUI POP UP.

NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON:
1) GRAPHVIZ LIBRARY
2) PIL LIBRARY

These can be installed by opening the command prompt, and typing in:
pip install graphviz
pip install pillow
pip install pydotplus

# OBJECTIVE
This project focuses on DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) minimization using Python and the tkinter library. DFA minimization is a crucial concept in automata theory, simplifying DFA while maintaining its functionality. With this project, users can input a DFA and visualize its minimized form through an intuitive tkinter-based GUI, enhancing their understanding of automata theory and computational concepts.
